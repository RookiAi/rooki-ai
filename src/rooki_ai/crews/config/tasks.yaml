load_corpus_task:
  description: >
    Load and normalize the Twitter corpus from the provided Supabase storage URL. Extract cleaned text samples and 
    provide statistics about the corpus. The corpus should include at least 300 samples, each around 1-2k characters.
    Remove URLs, normalize whitespace, but preserve emojis and hashtags.
  expected_output: "CorpusOut"
  agent: "corpus_agent"

compute_metrics_task:
  description: >
    Analyze the provided text samples to compute style metrics. Calculate sentence length, 
    imperative usage, emoji rate, hashtag rate, link rate, and determine the overall cadence style.
    If influencer metrics are provided, blend them into the analysis with appropriate weights.
  expected_output: "StyleProfile"
  agent: "metrics_agent"
  context: ["load_corpus_task"]

synthesize_voice_guide_task:
  description: >
    Create a voice guide suggestion based on the style profile and influencer data. The guide should include:
    1. A positioning statement in the format "For builders who need X, Brand is the Y that delivers Z"
    2. A tone classification (direct, helpful, witty, professional, or educational)
    3. Content pillars with appropriate weightings (weights should sum to approximately 1)  - you MUST create exactly {pillar} pillars (weights should sum to approximately 1)
    4. Guardrails with "do" and "don't" recommendations - you MUST create exactly {guardrail} guardrails
    
    IMPORTANT FOR METRICS: You MUST follow this specific format for ALL metrics objects:
    - post_metrics: Analyze with only tweets in posts. ContentMetrics with these EXACT fields:
      - avg_sentence_len: float - Average sentence length (words per sentence)
      - imperative_pct: float - Percentage of sentences that use imperative voice (0.0 to 1.0)
      - emoji_rate: float - Average number of emojis per word
      
    - reply_metrics: Analyze with only tweets in replies. ContentMetrics with the SAME EXACT fields
    - quoted_metrics: Analyze with only tweets in quotes. ContentMetrics with the SAME EXACT fields
    - long_form_text_metrics: Analyze with only tweets which are longer than 280 characters. ContentMetrics with the SAME EXACT fields

    The output must be schema-valid according to the VoiceGuideSuggestion model. Use the metrics 
    from the style profile to inform your recommendations.
